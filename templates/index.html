    <h1 class="header">OONIVERSITY</h1>
      <p>OONIVERSITY is the eLearning project built by Raccoon Gang using open edX platform functionality. It allows creating MOOCâ€™s from scratch or uploading the existing ones (via open edX Studio), as well as participating in these courses as a student or as an instructor (via open edX LMS).
      Just as open edX platform itself, Raccoon University has 2 independent domains - production and a sandbox. They are visually identical, yet they have different purpose and house 2 separate account systems. Our production domain, the Raccoon University itself, is regularly updated with the latest and stable working functionality and supports all the possibilities provided by open edX platform.
